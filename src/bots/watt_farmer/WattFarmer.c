// INSTRUCTION
// -> You MUST have y-comm glitch active and system time unsynced
// -> You MUST have set text speed to FAST
// -> You MUST stand in front of a wishing piece den
// -> You have to start this program at the Change Grip/Order menu
// -> There is a very small chance that the game will crash, the program will save every 50 tries
// -> Note that if today's date is end of month for EU, or December for US, first loop will fail, this is normal
// -> It takes ~10 seconds per watt collection
