// -> Set your date info here, date must be between 2000/1/1 to 2060/12/31 (22280 days advance)
// -> Use this website to check your end date: https://www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadd.html
// -> MAKE SURE the end date is within range, if your seed is over 22280 skips, enter the game
// to register the time skip, set a new start date, update this program and start again!
